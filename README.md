# Online Health Monitoring System

The Online Health Monitoring System was created as part of our Web Development Module's assignment. 

### Purpose


Why did we decide to go with The Online Health Monitoring System? We have chosen this specific topic because after much discussion we have come to the conclusion that elderly people are more likely to experience health-related issues often, so by creating this system, keeping track and monitoring the mental health and physical health of the elderly people can be excuted more effectively. 

### What did I learn?

This project was a challenging and a learning curve for me as this was my first hands on experience doing PHP code.
